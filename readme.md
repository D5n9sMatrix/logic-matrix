1.1.2 The center of gravity
The center of gravity is relative to two points that moves to the end of earth
where its seed is placed on the end of earth so we have a root composed of
two points gravity let‚Äôs say the start point and E1 which would be the end of
earth and its other point is P1 which the location of gravity on the earth‚Äôs
